Some comments on the DCPU-16 architecture - suggestions / feedback

- Providing BEQ val, reladdr / BNE val, reladdr would probably be more
  emulation-friendly than the IFE/IFN/IFG/IFB -- adjusting the PC is
  simpler/cheaper than maintaining a "skip next" flag, or decoding
  the length of the next instruction when processing the branch

- Suggest replacing the 0x1f-0x3f encodings for the "a" operand with
  alternatives to the literal/immediates.  Good candidates might be
  special registers (interrupt control, system, etc) or IO registers.

- Suggest making the immediate value in the [imm + reg] operand form
  signed, to allow easy access to locals from a frame pointer.  This
  also enables some other common data access patterns.

- Consider providing interrupts for cycle count and "wall clock"
  timers (if not general IO interrupts), to allow for preemptive
  multitasking (and/or just debugging/watchdog processes).
